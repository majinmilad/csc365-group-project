## Project Proposal: DRAFT
The Playlist Exchanger is a platform where users can upload and share playlists between Spotify and Apple Music. Users can easily pull and update playlists, ensuring they always have the latest tracks. The system enables collaborative playlist creation by genre, allowing users to contribute to and curate genre-specific collections. Additionally, users can cross-join playlists based on attributes like genre, tempo, or mood, automatically generating mixed playlists. The use of joins in the database will facilitate complex operations, like merging playlists on shared attributes, providing a seamless experience for users to discover new music through collaborative and dynamic exchanges.

## Style Guide
### Git
#### Commits
Make commit messages clear but concise and in the present tense.  
Examples: "Add database.py file" "Implement writing user account info to database" "Improve readability of example_function()" "Fix user login bug"  

Commit whenever you deem best, but it's common practice to make commits neither too large nor too small in scope. Usually, whenever you do some work you might consider to be a "single job" it's a good time to make a commit. If the job can't be described by a single concise commit message then it probably should have been broken into multiple commits. However, it's of course left to the discretion of the developer.  

Each commit has an optional description too. Use this (if desired) to expand on the commit message or write whatever you'd like regarding the commit work. If you do end up making a commit too large in scope to be adequetly described by a single commit message, make the best message as you can and then use the description to explain in further detail the changes made by the commit.  
#### Branches
We have two ways we can delegate work. We can make a branch for each member and communicate what we will work on. Or we can make temporary branches for individual jobs/features and assign people to work on specific branches. We can discuss how we'd like to do it together.  

Branches should be styled with all lowercase and '-' instead of spaces e.g. edson-branch or stable-working
