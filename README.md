## Style Guide
### Git
Make commit messages clear but concise and in the present tense.  
Examples: "Add database.py file" "Implement writing user account info to database" "Improve readability of example_function()" "Fix user login bug"  

Commit whenever you deem best, but it's common practice to make commits neither too large nor too small in scope. Usually, whenever you do some work you might consider to be a "single job" is a good time to make a commit. If the job can't be described by a single concise commit message then it probably is too large and should have been broken into multiple commits. However, it's of course left to the discretion of the developer.  

Each commit has an optional description too. Use this if desired to expand on the commit message or write whatever you'd like regarding the commit work. If you do end up making a commit too large in scope for a single commit message, the commit message will likely be vague so make it as clear as you can and then use the description to explain in further detail the changes made by the commit.
